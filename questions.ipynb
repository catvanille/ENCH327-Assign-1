    "a) Compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "The CO2 properties of interest for the compressor are its enthalpy, density, flow rate, temperature, and pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The change in enthalpy of the CO2 is important to determine the work required to compress the CO2, and the efficiency of the compressor. The density affects the required size of the compressor, and the amount of CO2 that can be compressed at a time (flow rate). The temperature and pressure of the CO2 are important to determine the state of the CO2, and the material the compressor needs to be made of to withstand the pressure of the CO2. With temperature, pressure, and volume, the compressibility can be calculated, which is important to determine the deviation of behaviour from an ideal gas, and the relationship at the different compression stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Pipeline transportation\n",
    "\n",
    "The CO2 properties of interest for pipeline transportation are the viscosity, density, corrosivity, temperature, and pressure.\n",
    "The viscosity of the CO2 is important to determine and minimize the pressure drop in the pipeline. Higher viscosity requires more pumping power to overcome the fricitional resistance. The density determines the amount of CO2 transported in a given pipeline volume, which would affect the cost of transportation and the size of the pipeline. The corrosivity of the CO2, especially with potiential impurities, is critical to determine the material of the pipeline, and the safety measures that need to be implemented. The temperature and pressure, which indicates its state and behaviour is important as when it is above its critial temperature and pressure, it behaves as a supercritical fluid, which offers high density and can be efficiently transported."
